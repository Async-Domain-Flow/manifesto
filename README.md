# Async Domain Flow – Manifesto

A conceptual and practical guide to the **Async Domain Flow (ADF)** architecture.  
This manifesto outlines the core principles, design patterns, and best practices that define ADF, providing a foundation for building scalable, asynchronous, and domain-centric systems.

---

## 📖 Introduction
**Async Domain Flow (ADF)** is an architectural approach that emphasizes:  
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Leveraging event-driven patterns to ensure scalability and resilience.  
- **Domain-Centric Design:** Focusing on business logic and domain boundaries.  
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear layers and responsibilities within the architecture.  

This repository serves as a comprehensive manifesto, explaining the philosophy, components, and patterns behind ADF.

## 🌟 Core Principles
- **Asynchrony First:** Prioritize non-blocking, event-driven workflows.  
- **Domain Isolation:** Separate concerns and enforce boundaries between contexts.  
- **Resilience by Design:** Use retries, circuit breakers, and failover patterns.  
- **Atomic Functions:** Ensure each component performs a single, clear responsibility.  
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Employ queues, events, and pub/sub mechanisms.

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview
The Async Domain Flow architecture is structured around six key layers:

1. **Interfaces:** Interfaces that capture external inputs (e.g., APIs, queues, webhooks).  
2. **Domains:** Domain services and use cases.  
3. **Entidades (Entities):** Core business models and rules.  
4. **Storages:** Repositories for persistence.  
5. **Communications:** Event-driven messaging systems.  
6. **Integrations:** Connections to external services and APIs.
7. **Plataform:** Provide shared services and cross-cutting infrastructure tô support all layers of the architecture.

## 📐 Design Patterns
- **CQRS:** Separate read and write concerns for performance.  
- **Event Sourcing:** Store state changes as a sequence of events.  
- **Saga Pattern:** Manage long-running transactions in distributed systems.  
- **Domain Services:** Centralize complex domain logic outside of entities.  
- **Observer Pattern:** Use event listeners for decoupled communication.
